<h2>BIGBANG</h2>
<img src="bigbang.jpg" width="100%">
<p>The Big Bang theory describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature.
<br>It is the prevailing cosmological model explaining the evolution of the observable universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale form.
<br>The model offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, and large-scale structure.</p>
<p>Crucially, the theory is compatible with Hubble–Lemaître law—the observation that the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from Earth.
<br>Extrapolating this cosmic expansion backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the theory describes an increasingly concentrated cosmos preceded by a singularity in which space and time lose meaning (typically named "the Big Bang singularity").
<br>Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang singularity at an estimated 13.787 ± 0.020 billion years ago, which is considered the age of the universe.</p>
