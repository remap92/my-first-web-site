<h2>WHAT IS THE COSMOS</h2>
<p><strong><u>The universe</u> (Latin: universus)</strong> is all of space and time and their contents, including planets, stars, galaxies, and all other forms of matter and energy.
<br><a href="https://www.space.com/25126-big-bang-theory.html" target="_blank" title="what is bigbang">The Big Bang theory</a> is the prevailing cosmological description of the development of the universe.</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">According to this theory, space and time emerged together 13.787±0.020 billion years ago,and the universe has been expanding ever since the Big Bang.
<br>While the spatial size of the entire universe is unknown,it is possible to measure the size of the observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day.</p>
<p style="margin-top:40px;">The earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center.
<br>Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System.
<br>In developing the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.</p>
